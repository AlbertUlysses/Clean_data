# Clean_Data
Clean-Data is a simple framework that takes data cleaning step by step. In the Jupyter notebook you will find an explanation and documentation of what I did to a raw data set. The data is from Kaggle and the notebook has a link to the original data.

## Install
This project currently does not have a virtual environment of it's own. I will revisit this and create a requirements.txt file for anyone interested in running the notebook.
